# Predictive Modelling for Bank Marketing Campaigns

## Introduction
This project analyzes and predicts the outcomes of direct marketing campaigns of a banking institution through phone calls, aiming to determine whether a client will subscribe to a bank term deposit. The study addresses the significant challenge of processing diverse client demographics and economic indicators to accurately predict subscription outcomes.

## Data and Processing
The dataset comprises various client attributes, including age, contact duration, campaign contacts, and economic indicators like employment variation rates and consumer price index. Preprocessing steps included encoding categorical variables, handling missing values, and applying SMOTE for data balancing.

## Modeling and Methodology
We utilized Decision Tree, XGBoost, and LightGBM algorithms due to their interpretability, efficiency, and performance on structured data. An ensemble method combining XGBoost and LightGBM was also explored to leverage the strengths of both models.

## Results
The models demonstrated robust performance, with the ensemble method slightly outperforming individual models in terms of precision and recall. Key findings include the impact of class imbalance on model bias and the importance of hyperparameter tuning in preventing overfitting.

## Conclusion
The study highlights the effectiveness of comprehensive data preprocessing and advanced modeling techniques in tackling imbalanced datasets. Through scientific exploration and tuning, we developed predictive models that provide insights for optimizing bank marketing campaigns.
